This version of 'bizz_buzz' program is especially good because:

        * the program gives you short and clear explanation of its main algorithm

        * if error is encountered, the full log of this failure is given

        * the program utilizes 'size_t' for indexing the strings and numbers, so you
                should try really hard to overflow it;

        * (applies to 'file' version only) reading from file buffered, the buffer has
                adjustable size

        * (applies to 'file' version only) the minimum access mode policy
                was used (O_RDONLY)

        * if there was any possibility of using the library function, it was used,
                so, no wheel reinventing was done

        * the program uses overflow-protected algorithms to check divisibility of the
                numbers

        * no warning generated using '-Wall', warnings only about 'C++ style comments'
                appears, when using '-pedantic'

        * both versions checked with 'valgrind': "All heap blocks were freed --
                no leaks are possible"
