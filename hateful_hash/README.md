As I understood this task, we need to write really bad code, in order to feel
how it is difficult to understood and debug what you have just wrote.

This includes strange names, magic constants, unsafe functions, different
"optimisations" and so on. But this should not include intentional obfuscation.

One thing, that is off this ideology is that I hided constants, but without
this, algorithm will become to easy to google.

So, this is quite easy to solve CTF-like puzzle, with few easter eggs inside.

P.S.: I am not able to write a lot of such code, so I wrote slightly more than one line =)
